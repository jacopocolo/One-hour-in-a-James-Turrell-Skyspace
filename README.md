# One-hour-in-a-James-Turrell-Skyspace

A simple (and slightly messy) Unity project for a very simple first person game. Read more and [download the game on itch.io](https://jacopocolo.itch.io/one-hour-in-a-james-turrell-skyspace-the-color-inside). 

This games uses:
- Some standard Unity effects like Blur. 
- [First person drifter controller for unity3d](http://torahhorse.com/first-person-drifter-controller-for-unity3d) by Ben Esposito.
- [Simple Dynamic Clouds](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/bfw-simple-dynamic-clouds-85665) by Butterfly World.

I removed [the audio](https://freesound.org/people/shuraifa/sounds/412702/) because it's released under under Creative Commons license BY-NC 3.0 and I'm not sure it plays nice with GNU General Public License v3.0. It's pretty easy to add audio back to Unity project anyway.
